# gaussmeter-in-python
Magnetic field sensor, readings in microteslas (ÂµT), designed for the mobile sensor mag-akm09918.
A tool for understanding and quantifying magnetic fields, allowing measurements and analysis.
It can be used to measure the strength of magnetic fields in various applications, such as in scientific research, industrial processes and cybersecurity assesments such as:

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Detection: In cybersecurity, electromagnetic radiation and interference can have implications for the security and integrity of electronic devices and systems. A gaussmeter can be used to detect and measure electromagnetic fields emitted by electronic devices, power lines, or other sources that may cause interference or compromise the security of sensitive data.

Physical Security Assessments: Gaussmeters can be used as part of physical security assessments to identify and analyze the magnetic signatures of different electronic components or systems. For example, they can help detect hidden magnetic locks or identify magnetic anomalies that may indicate tampering or unauthorized access.

Magnetic Data Storage: Magnetic storage devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), use magnetic fields to store and retrieve data. Gaussmeters can be used to analyze the magnetic fields produced by these storage devices and assist in understanding their behavior, vulnerabilities, or potential for data leakage.
